.ADDSPRITE:matsuri_close.png
Suddenly, an anime girl appears!
.FLIPSPRITE:matsuri_close.png
Gonna try and save the game now...
.SYSTEMCALL:AUTOSAVE
Also hopefully this got saved.

That wasn't strange at all.

Well, you've made your choice.
.ISFLAG:matsuri_color:1:You like the full-color version better, huh?

.SETCONVERSATION:sketch





LABEL vacation in europe:

Europe is pretty awesome if you go in the summer.
Anyway give me a second to wipe the choice set data.
.WIPECHOICESET:vacation spots
OK so what about Europe again?
It's pretty awesome.

LABEL vacation in canada:

Do you mean like the Canadian Alps, or the big cities?
I'll wipe the choice set first.
.WIPECHOICESET:vacation spots
So yeah, Canada has some surprisingly good food.
It's pretty chilly though.

LABEL vacation in thailand:

Bangkok or the beaches in the south?
Let me wipe the choice set data first
.WIPECHOICESET:vacation spots

LABEL vacation in hawaii:

Yeah, Hawaii is pretty sweet.
.WIPECHOICESET:vacation spots
Also I wiped the choice sets just now.
I don't know what else to say about this.


LABEL sketch:
.SETSPRITEALIAS:matsuri:sketchmatsuri_close.png
.ADDSPRITE:matsuri
Matsuri reappears, but now she just looks like a sketch of an anime girl.
.ISFLAGMORETHAN:matsuri_color:0:You shouldn't see this.
.ISFLAGLESSTHAN:matsuri_color:1:The sketch version is more "pure," I suppose?

label color:
.SETSPRITEALIAS:matsuri:matsuri_close.png
.ADDSPRITE:matsuri
Matsuri reappears, in color again!
.ISFLAGMORETHAN:matsuri_color:0:The colorful version is better, I'd say.
.ISFLAGLESSTHAN:matsuri_color:1:You shouldn't see this.
Well, that's that for now!


label showchoicejumptest:
Alright, we're going to test the .SHOWCHOICEANDJUMP command.
.SHOWCHOICEANDJUMP:Do you want to go to the moon or to Mars?:The Moon, baby!:spacemoon:Mars is cooler:spacemars


label spacemars:
You're right, it's better to go to Mars.
Maybe you can find the rover that went there.
Also, at least there's some atmosphere.
Even if it's just CO2.
I wonder if all that red would get weird after a while?

LABEL spacemoon:
Let's be real, the moon would be more practical.
And a moon base would be pretty awesome.
Plus you can look up at the sky and see Earth, which is pretty awesome.
I wonder if there's any flags left standing on the moon?
