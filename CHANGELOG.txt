version 1.2.3 October 1, 2023
. Added "fade in" UI feature for when the user needs to make a choice, as having the boxes fade in very quickly (about 0.2 seconds) looks nicer than the choices just instantly appearing on screen. 

version 1.2.2 Sep-2-2023
. Added commands for comparing the numerical value of flags against other flags.
. Added commands for modifying flags using the values stored in other flags.

version 1.2.1 Oct-1-2022
. Added "Choice Sets" functionality for dynamically adding and removing entries to a user "choice" segment.
. Also fixed a bug with choices segments where choices didn't display properly if there were too many choices (turned out this was an issue with the buttons Y coordinates).

version 1.2 Dec-27-2021
. Updated for use with iOS 15.2
. Now uses SMTextNode for text: the project is now all-Swift and no longer uses Objective-C classes

version 1.1.2 Jul-03-2020
. SMRecord has been streamlined, and experimental support for iCloud saving has been added.
. SporkVN now targets iOS 12 by default.

version 1.1.1 Sep-14-2018
. Updated for iOS 12.

version 1.1.0 Jan-21-2018
. [NEW] Changed VNScene to VNSceneNode. This is mostly done for games that aren't "pure" visual novels, and where SporkVN is just used to power short dialogue sequences. Since the visual novel "scene" is now just a node, it can be added to an existing SKScene subclass, and removed when the dialogue is done. This doesn't really affect games that are purely visual novels.

Now a visual novel scene can just be dropped into an existing scene (for things like dialogue between characters, etc) instead of just requiring an entirely new SKScene instance to be made.

version 1.0.4 Aug-22-2016
. [NEW] Added .ROLLDICE and .MODIFYCHOICEBOXOFFSET script commands.

version 1.0.3.2 Aug-17-2016
. [MISC] Updated to run on Xcode 8 beta 6.

version 1.0.3.1 Aug-02-2016
. [MISC] Updated to run on Xcode 8 beta 4.

version 1.0.3 Jul-09-2016
. [MISC] Updated to run on Swift v3.0. Currently using Xcode 8 beta 2, which is meant for iOS 10 beta 2. This code might need to be updated for later betas (and the final version of iOS 10).

version 1.0.2 May-05-2016
. [FIX] Rewrote "for loops," since Xcode kept showing warnings that C-style "for loops" would be deprecated in future versions of Swift.

version 1.0.1 Mar-21-2016
. [NEW] Can now change speechbox color, the text color in the speechbox, and the label color in buttons, from the "vnscene view settings.plist" file.

version 1.0.0 Feb-16-2016
. [NEW] Ported EKVN from Objective-C to Swift to create SporkVN
